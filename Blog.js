        <p className="para_one">
          Many years ago, as a young man, I dreamt of an opportunity that will afford people, regardless of age, gender, socio-economic status,<br/> and educational background the opportunity to realize their life dreams. I was an idealist; I had always believed<br/> that good things are in store for those who are willing to work hard for their dreams.<br/> Although my environment inculcated to my young minds that such was just a myth and opportunities of<br/> that kind didn't exist, I lead on to my hopes.
        </p>
        <p className="para_two">
          Then one day, I stumbled upon this industry called Software Enterprise and Marketing. As I said "eureka!",<br/> I excitingly embarked on the journey of my life. The dreamer in me, who was yearning for an opportunity to realize my full potential,<br/> found its home. This industry continues to amaze me, with its power to breach <br/>cultural, religious, social, and political barriers and be an equalizer of <br/>statuses, it empowers people to change their lives and their environment.
